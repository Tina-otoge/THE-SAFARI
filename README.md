# THE SAFARI
A Flexible Blog framework

THE SAFARI Project is a blogging framework project built alone aiming to give intermediate and novice developers a PHP environment of variables and functions to quickly implements a working blog.
There's no front-end, it's just ready-to-use functions and variables.

## Deployment
THE SAFARI is made to be implemented into a PHP 7 / MySQL system.  
Other database solutions are considered but not planned to be implemented before the first release.  
:warning: IMPORTANT :warning: : Every THE SAFARI file MUST be placed outside of the web server folder.

## Please be gentle
This project is in a very early state, there's not much implemented and the readme file isn't even finished.
